# Operators
1. Arithmetics Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Relational Operators
4. Logical Operators

## 1. Arithmetics Operators
- Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data. 
- For example, `a+b`

| Operator | Operation    |
| -------- | ------------ |
| +        | Addition     |
| -        | Subtraction  |
| /        | Division     |
| *        | Multiplication|
| %        | Modulos      |
- Modulos operator operates Remainder after division.
### * Increment and Decrement Operators
- `++` increases the value of the operand by 1
- `--` decreases it by 1
- For Example, `int a = 12;` `print(++a);`

## 2. Assignment Operators
- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
- For Example, `num1 +=23;`

| Operator    | Description                              | Example              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| =           | Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left | `x = 5;` |
| +=          | Adds the value on the right to the variable and assigns the result to the variable | `x += 3;` (Equivalent to `x = x + 3;`) |
| -=          | Subtracts the value on the right from the variable and assigns the result to the variable | `x -= 2;` (Equivalent to `x = x - 2;`) |
| *=          | Multiplies the variable by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable | `x *= 4;` (Equivalent to `x = x * 4;`) |
| /=          | Divides the variable by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable | `x /= 2;` (Equivalent to `x = x / 2;`) |
| %=          | Assigns the remainder of the division of the variable by the value on the right to the variable | `x %= 3;` (Equivalent to `x = x % 3;`) |


## 3. Relation Operators
- A relational operator is used to check the relationship between two operands. 
-For example, `a<b`checking a is less than b or not.

| Operator  | Operation    |
| --------- | ------------ |
| =         | Is Equal To  |
| !=        | Not Equal To |
| >         | Greater than |
| <         | Less than    |
| >=        | > Equal to   |
| <=        | < Equal to   |

## 4. Logical Operators
- Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false.
- If the expression is true, it returns 1 whereas if the expression is false, it returns 0.

| Operator | Description           | Example  |
|----------|-----------------------|----------|
| AND      | Returns true if both operands are true | `true && false` returns `false` |
| OR       | Returns true if at least one operand is true | true || false returns `true` |
| NOT      | Returns the opposite of the operand's value | `!true` returns `false` |
