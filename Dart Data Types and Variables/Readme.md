# Datatypes & Variables

## Datatypes
- The fundamentals of programming and help define the structure and behaviour of variables.

## Variables
- Variables are used to store data values.
- The name given to the memory location is called variables.
- A variable has a data type such as number, string (for text), date, and Boolean (for true or false).

## Some rules for variables
1. Variable names should not begin with numbers (integers), but ending in num is acceptable. For example, `int 1_age` is invalid, but `int age_1` is. 
2. Keywords should not appear in variable names. For example, `int int = 18;` is incorrect. 
3. Variable names should not contain white spaces. `String my name` is valid when used instead of (_) of `String my_name`.

### Types of Variables
There are two types of variables:
- Local variable
- Global variable

**Local variables** are those that are in scope within a
a specific part of the program (function, procedure,
method, or subroutine, depending on the
programming language employed).

**Global variables** are those that are in scope for the
duration of the program execution. They can be
accessed by any part of the program, and are readwrite for all statements that access them.
