### Types of Variables
There are two types of variables:
– Local variable
– Global variable

**Local variables** are those that are in scope within a
specific part of the program (function, procedure,
method, or subroutine, depending on the
programming language employed).
**Global variables** are those that are in scope for the
duration of the programs execution. They can be
accessed by any part of the program, and are readwrite for all statements that access them.
